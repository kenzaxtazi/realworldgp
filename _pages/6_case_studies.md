The following section describes implementation details of four case studies. The GPs are in implemented in `GPytorch` and `GPflow` in `Jupyter` notebooks. Come back soon to implement these directly with binder/Google Colab!

## 6.1. Glacier elevation change (GP interpolation)

The framework is applied to glacier elevation change over Greenland using data derived from ICESat and ICESat-2 satellites. In this regression problem, we would like to estimate glacier elevation change at unsampled locations. This case study has direct applications to estimating sea level rise. Ocean distance, topographic elevation, slope, aspect, surface glacier velocity, and spatial coordinates - are used as inputs $D=7$. The dataset is also large with $ N=5 \times 10^5$. We compare the framework with a pre-existing application of GPs. The model is evaluated with an emphasis on capturing extremes. We compare the framework with a pre-existing application of GPs to this problem by [Gardner et al. (2019)](<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFM.C41A..08G>).

## 6.2. Himalayan precipitation (GP extraloplation)

The aim of this case study is to predict future precipitation in the Upper Indus Basin, Himalayas. We use ERA5 climate reanalysis data and historical atmospheric indices (derived from observations). The data has data points $N=1\times 10^6$, possible input dimensions $D=29$.

## 6.3. Lorenz 96 model (Multi task GP)

We apply multi-task GP to learn the physical relationships between dimensions of the Lorenz 96 model in order to forecast future behaviour. The Lorenz 96 model is often used as simpler proxy for climate model as it can recreate the chaotic patterns observed in the atmosphere. It is therefore a useful tool to test new ideas such as better parametrisation schemes. The dataset is large with  $N=4 \times 10^5$, $D=1$, and $M=8$. In this task, it is important that the samples generated by the model share the same properties as the data and follow the test proposed by [Parthipan et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14814).

## 6.4. Ocean turbulence (Classification)

Finally we apply the framework to to water mass classification in the Arctic. The uncertainty in the prediction are used to infer the probabilities in potential mixing. Coordinates and depth, are used ($D=3$). The dataset is also large with $N=1 \times 10^5$.

## 6.5. Further reading

Below are further examples of GPs studies (with code) that deal with scalibity and kernel design for real world problems.
