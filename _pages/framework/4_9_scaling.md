## Step 9: Scaling

If the modeller is using a large dataset, they can now apply their findings from Step 5. In particular, they will either apply one of the previously discussed scaling methods or apply independent GPs to chunked data to make predictions using a Bayesian Committee Machine. This can be implemented using the [`guepard`](https://github.com/NicolasDurrande/guepard) library.
